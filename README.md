TravelAgency Python Application
This is a simple Python-based Travel Agency management system that allows users to manage trips, view available and upcoming trips, and provide customer services such as trip updates and cancellations. The application offers functionality for adding new trips, capturing traveller details, processing payments, and more.

Features
View Trips: Displays available and upcoming trips.
Add Trip: Allows adding new trips, with the option to mark them as "available" or "upcoming."
Customer Details: Captures personal details of travellers, including name, contact number, and email address.
Payment: Prompts for payment details after booking a trip.
Customer Service:
Trip Update: Update the name of an existing trip.
Trip Cancellation: Cancel an existing trip.
Simple Console Interface: Interact with the system through a straightforward menu interface.
How to Use
Run the Program: Start the application by running the Python script. The program will display a menu with options to view trips, add new trips, access customer services, or exit.

Add a Trip: After selecting the "Add Trip" option, you can specify the trip name and type ("available" or "upcoming"). Then, traveller details (name, contact, email) are captured, followed by a payment prompt.
